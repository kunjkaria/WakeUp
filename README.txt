This is basically a python script for alarm for your laptop. Anyways, there are laptops which support the feature. 
Toshiba users can just use this http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/alarm.1.html
But for others, this is a small script.
This script runs banshee player at the time alarm has to ring.
Run it, set the time, have a good sound sleep! 
Cheers! :)
